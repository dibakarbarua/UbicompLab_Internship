Hey Guys

This is my Repository for my Summer Project which I did at the
Mobile and Ubiquitous Computing Group, IIIT Delhi in Summer, 2013.
I interfaced various sensors on various protocols on the Raspberry Pi
and made an extension board for the fronend to a Cloud-based Sensor
data acquisition system called SENSORACT.
